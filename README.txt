INTRO:
	The purpose of this project is to create a an algorithm that traverses through rooms (nodes) of a cave subsystem (graph). This is accomplished using depth-first search traversal of the graph. The order the nodes are visited depends on a few rules: ID Limit Rule, Sum Rule, Single Same Rule. The traversal is stopped once it has visited the room closest to the center.
